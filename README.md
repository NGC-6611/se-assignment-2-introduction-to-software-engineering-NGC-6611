Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering Instructions: Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.
Questions: 
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is the process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to fill gaps and solve real-world problems through programming and software engineering principles.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
Programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute, preferably in a format it can understand. Software engineering, on the other hand, is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, creation and maintenance of computer software using programming languages. The two differ in that software engineering focuses more broadly on software in terms of creation, improvement, and management, while traditional programming has its focus on writing of the code that supports the software.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. 
The Software Development Life Cycle is a process in Software development that ensures maximum efficiency by enabling the production of high-quality, low-cost software in the shortest time possible, through testing.
The SDLC involves seven stages,
The planning phase involves gathering requirements, defining project scope, and establishing objectives. The development team analyses the project to understand user needs and system functionalities. The design phase involves translating high-level requirements into a detailed technical design, including technologies, platforms, and data structures. The implementation phase involves coding, following coding standards and best practices. Testing is conducted to identify defects and ensure the software meets quality standards. After successful testing, the software is prepared for deployment to the production environment. Finally, the maintenance phase involves ongoing support, updates, and enhancements, ensuring the software's reliability and performance in production.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? 
Agile and waterfall are both project-management methodologies.
The main difference between the two methodologies is that Waterfall is a linear system of working that requires the team to complete each project phase before moving on to the next one while Agile encourages the team to work simultaneously on different phases of the project regardless of completion progress.
Agile was developed as a flexible method that welcomes incorporating changes of direction even late in the process, as well as accounting for stakeholders’ feedback throughout the process. While the  Waterfall methodology may be rigid and take years to complete, Agile allows for  incorporation of feedback during development resulting in the most refined product possible, however this can lead to overlap and unnecessary effort and energy expended due to different tasks running simultaneously.
The Waterfall methodology is a linear form of project management ideal for projects where the end result is clearly established from the beginning of the project. The expectations for the project and the deliverables of each stage are clear and are required in order to progress to the next phase,deliverables in this methodology are clearly defined and timelines are mapped out from the beginning, making it rather efficient.
Agile is better suited for projects where stakeholders are closely involved every step of the way. Waterfall is a more structured project management method and does not lend itself to the same type of flexibility.
 Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. 
Requirements Engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analysing, specifying,validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is a systematic approach to the definition, creation and verification of requirements for a software system.
It entails several tasks that help in understanding, recording and managing the demands of stakeholders. These tasks include a feasibility study, where the product is weighed against economic,operational and technical criteria to check for effectiveness, efficiency and necessity.
Next, is the requirements elicitation stage which has to do with gaining knowledge about the product domain and requirements through brainstorming, prototyping and even interviews.
Third, is the requirements specification stage, this is the process of documenting the requirements identified in the analysis step in a clear, consistent and unambiguous manner. It also includes prioritising and breaking down the requirements into manageable chunks.
Fourth, is the requirements verification and validation stage. Verification refers to the set of tasks that ensures the software correctly implements a specific function while Validation refers to the set of tasks that ensures that the software is traceable to customer requirements.
Lastly, is requirements management which entails analysis, documentation, tracking, prioritisation and agreement on the set requirements in conjunction with communication with relevant stakeholders.
Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
The process of disassembling a system into more manageable, self-contained modules or components that may be independently developed, tested, and maintained is known as modular software design. Where each module communicates with other modules via well defined interfaces and performs a given task or encompasses a certain collection of related functionalities.
Modularity aims to enhance software systems' scalability and ‘maintainability’ by allowing for the isolation of changes, reducing the risk of unexpected negative effects and facilitating long-term system maintenance. The modules provide interfaces for communication, making system comprehension and analysis easier, allowing developers to focus on smaller, more manageable components.
Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). 
Unit testing is a process of testing individual software units or components in isolation, ensuring they function as expected.
 Integration testing verifies the interaction between different units, identifying potential issues like communication failures or interface mismatches.
System testing is the entire software system, validating it against its requirements and specifications. 
Acceptance testing evaluates the software's compliance with business requirements and user needs, ensuring it meets stakeholder expectations. These testing levels are typically conducted sequentially, building upon the previous one to ensure the software's quality and reliability.
Why is testing crucial in software development? 
Software testing is a crucial activity in the software development life cycle that aims to evaluate and improve the quality of software products.
Testing provides several important benefits. For instance:
Software testing verifies that the software functions as expected and meets requirements specifications. Testing also identifies defects and flaws in the software early in the development lifecycle when they are less expensive to fix. In addition to this, software testing reduces project risks related to software quality, security and performance, for example, software defects can lead to system failures, data breaches, slow performance and other significant impacts.
 
Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems (VCS) are software tools that help manage changes to source code over time. They track modifications to files, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. Version control systems maintain a history of changes, enabling developers to revert to previous versions if necessary, track who made specific changes, and merge modifications from different branches.
Examples include Git, Subversion,Mercurial and Perforce.
Git:
Features: Distributed version control, branching and merging, lightweight and fast, support for large projects, offline support, extensive ecosystem of tools and services.
Subversion (SVN):
Features: Centralised version control, support for directories, atomic commits, file locking, branching and tagging.
Mercurial:
Features: Distributed version control, branching and merging, lightweight and fast, easy to use, suitable for projects of any size.
 
 Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? 
A software project manager takes the overall responsibilities to manage the software projects and plays an important role in the successful completion of the projects.
Key Responsibilities:
Project Planning: Defining the project scope, objectives, deliverables, timelines, as well as resource requirements.
Team Management: Building and leading a team of developers, designers, testers, and other key stakeholders.
Communication: Ensuring effective communication among team members, clients, and other stakeholders to convey project progress, requirements, and issues therefore ensuring seamlessness during the process.
Risk Management: Identifying potential risks to the project's success and implementing strategies to mitigate them for damage control.
Quality Assurance: Establishing quality standards, conducting reviews, and ensuring adherence to coding standards and best practices.
Key Challenges:
Scope Creep: Uncontrolled changes to project scope, requirements, or deliverables, leading to increased costs and delays.
Resource Constraints: Limited availability of skilled personnel, equipment, or budgetary constraints can pose challenges to project execution.
Time Constraints: Meeting tight deadlines while ensuring the quality and completeness of deliverables can be challenging.

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? 
 Software maintenance is the process of modifying, updating, and enhancing software applications to meet user needs and adapt to technology. It involves fixing bugs, adjusting to new environments, improving performance, and preventing potential issues. 
Software maintenance can be corrective, adaptive, perfective, or preventive. It is essential for bug fixing, adapting to change, enhancing features, optimising performance, and ensuring security. It helps developers address issues, maintain relevance and competitiveness, and ensures software remains responsive and scalable. Additionally, maintenance helps prevent security threats and protect sensitive data. Overall, software maintenance is a critical part of the software lifecycle.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? 
 
Some ethical issues software engineers might face include:
Transparency and Honesty in Decision-Making: In any case of developing, designing, and improving software and processes, engineers and developers should maintain a mindset of transparency about how the software works. They should also be accountable for their software and its intentions. This requires clear documentation of algorithms and decision-making processes. For example, in the context of transparency, engineers building self-driving cars need to ensure the legibility of their cars' decision-making processes, especially in incidents or ethical dilemma
Software Engineers may also face dilemmas regarding the collection, storage, and use of user data. Ensuring that data is handled securely and transparently while respecting user privacy is crucial. For instance, a software engineer working on a social media platform might need to decide how much user data to collect and whether to make posts anonymous or use pseudonyms  to protect user privacy.
